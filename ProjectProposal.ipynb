    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "This dataset can be used to classify a mushroom as edible or poisonous based on the cap shape, cap surface texture, cap color, the existence of bruises, odor, if and how the gill is attachment, the gills' spacing, gill size, gill color, stalk shape, stalk root, the texture of the stalk surface above and below the ring, stalk color above and below the ring, the veil type, veil color, the number of rings, type of ring(s), spore print color, the size and distribution of the population, and the habitat\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dataset Format and Contents\n",
    "The dataset contains 8,124 instances with 23 columns (22 feature attributes and 1 class label). All features are categorical and encoded as single letter abbreviations. The dataset is well balanced with 4,208 edible mushrooms (51.8%) and 3,916 poisonous mushrooms (48.2%). The dataset is also complete with no missing values, though it might require encoding for some categorical values. "

    "\n",
    "Pre-processing Challenges:\n",
    "- Categorical feature encoding: All 22 features are categorical with single letter encodings that will need to be converted to numerical representations. We'll need to decide between encoding techniques depending on the classifier we implement.\n",
    "- Irrelevant feature: The veil type attribute has only 1 unique value across all instances, so this feature should be removed during pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Challenges:\n",
    "- Class balance: The dataset is relatively balanced (51.8% edible, 48.2% poisonous), but we'll need to ensure there is no bias in our classifier and include evaluation metrics beyond accuracy.\n",
    "- Overfitting: With 22 features and 8,124 instances, we'll need to ensure the model generalizes well and we do not accidentally overfit our classifier. \n",

    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "Several groups could be interested in these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Outdoorsy people: Individuals who gather wild mushrooms to eat need reliable methods to distinguish safe from poisonous options.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Poison control centers: Medical professionals who respond to mushroom poisoning cases could benefit from understanding predictive features and potentially use the model as a rapid assessment tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Educators and ublic health officials: Teachers and professionals in relevant fields could use the project as a reference to applying data science to biological classification and to advice the public on how to look out for accidental poisoning.\n",
