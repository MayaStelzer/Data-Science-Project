# Mushroom Classification

## Project Overview

This project classifies mushrooms as edible or poisonous using the UCI Mushroom Dataset. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification using three algorithms studied in class:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

The goal is to compare classifier performance, explore feature distributions, and use test-driven development to implement and evaluate the models.
